Bu hafta bizlere Üstün  React.js konulu bir sunum yapacak.

React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, released by Facebook more than 1 year ago. Since then, it has been gaining adoption in the industry since it makes it easy to build UI’s in a much simpler, more robust and performant way: it fixes many of the main issues in frontend development. This talk will be an introduction to React.js, we’ll go over the core principles and show some simple examples.
