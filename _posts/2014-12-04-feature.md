title: Measuring Business Value in Agile Projects
---


Software development is complex, expensive and time-consuming. Every business wants to get the highest return on projects, yet success remains typically grounded in achieving schedule, scope and budget. We argue that different metrics, focused on the business outcome of the delivered software, are more realistic measures of success.

Continuous measurement of business outcomes combined with hypothesis driven development generates a fast feedback cycle, a foundation to fail fast and aligns software delivery to business strategy and objectives. 

In this talk we will share projects where we experimented and succeeded embedding methods of continuously measuring business outcomes into the software development process. We regularly defined and used different metrics at a story level to get fast feedback against hypothesis and at project governance level to ensure we were on track to meet the project targets.
