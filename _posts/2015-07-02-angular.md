 Bio: Curtis Erhart has been developing web application since 1995, when he attended the first ever Java One conference at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. He started out as a Java and Cold Fusion developer  but soon found a new home on the Microsoft stack, moving through asp classic, to web forms, to MVC, and finally to Web API. He is a full stack developer but is most at home writing C#. You can currently find him toiling away in the Otelz.com salt mines.
