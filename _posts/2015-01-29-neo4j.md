Bu hafta bizlere, "Neo4j" başlıklı bir sunum yapılacak.

Me:
Brian Underwood is a developer evangelist for Neo Technology (the
makers of the Neo4j graph database) and has worked as an engineer for
Couchsurfing and Good Eggs.  He would describe himself as a software
craftsman with an obsession for data.  Originally from Ohio, he is
currently on a two year trip around the world with his wife and son.

The talk:
Graph databases store data in a graph, the most generic of data
structures, capable of elegantly representing any kind of data in a
highly accessible way.  Please join Brian Underwood for a discussion
of Neo4j, the world's leading graph database.  Topics covered will be:

- Concepts behind graph databases and Neo4j specifically
- Ideal use cases and interesting applications of Neo4j
- Demonstrate the usage of Cypher, Neo4j's built-in query language

cheers
