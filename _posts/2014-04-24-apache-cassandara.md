Bu hafta Datastax'dan (Cassandara'nin Resmi Kurumsal Destekcisi) Rustam Aliyev Barselona'dan gelip Ileri Cassandra hakkinda bir konusma yapacak.

This week Rustam Aliyev from Datastax (Official Cassandara EA supporter) will fly from Barcelona and give the talk about Advanced Cassandra. However, there will be limited number of seats available. Please RSVP with your guests for us to plan accordingly. Talk will be in Turkish, however there will be English explanations every now and then.

Topic: 

Deep dive into CQL and CQL improvements in Cassandra 2.1.

Description:

 Cassandra Query Language (CQL) provides an API to Cassandra that is simpler than the Thrift API for new applications. It adds an abstraction layer that hides implementation details and provides native syntaxes for collections and other common encodings. However, it is still important to understand what is happening beneath CQL.

In this talk we will go through CQL3 structures and see how they are implemented internally. We will also go through common CQL use cases and capabilities. Finally, we will quickly look into upcoming CQL improvements in Cassandra 2.1.

Bio:

Rustam Aliyev works as Solutions Architect at DataStax EMEA. Prior to DataStax Rustam was engineering cloud services at Skype (Microsoft). He's also author of ElasticInbox - open-source, distributed email storage system based on Cassandra.
