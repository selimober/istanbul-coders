title: A introduction on functional programming with F#
---

Bu hafta bizlere Jeroen  A introduction on functional programming with F# konulu bir sunum yapacak.

bio:

Senior Consultant for the London office of ThoughtWorks. Loves functional programming, distributed systems and beer.

abstract:

A introduction on functional programming with F#. We are gonna look at the language, how our code looks like when using recursion as the main control structure. We will look at algebraic datatypes (which sound a lot more complicated than they are) and if there is any time left we will play around a bit with type providers, an unique feature of the F# language. Of course we will compare all the examples with equivalent code in C# to see how much more awesome F# actually is.
